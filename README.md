# Ivirius.UI.Controls

The official components library from Ivirius, providing you with beautiful WinUI controls.

## Getting started

To use the package in your app, simply download it from NuGet (most preferably from the NuGet Package Manager GUI in Visual Studio, but you can also get it from the project's NuGet page). Afer this has completed, simply add the package to the project just like you would add any other NuGet package.

### Prerequisites

This package requires at least Windows App SDK 1.5.240311000 and at least Microsoft.Windows.SDK.BuildTools 10.0.22621.756. Also make sure that you app is a WinUI3/Windows App SDK project, and that its TFM (target framework) is net8.0-windows10.0.19041.0 or higher (net8.0-windows10.0.22621.0 counts as a higher version, for example, and net7.0-windows10.0.22621.0 counts as a lower version). There is no port to UWP (Universal Windows Platform) yet, but there should be one in the forseeable future.

## Usage

There are two official sample apps for this package:
- ReboundHub is the official sample app for Ivirius.UI.Controls, and samples from ReboundHub are recommended for use in production apps. It gets updated with a new version soon after a new library version is released.
- Ivirius.UI.Controls.Test, which is included in this repository under the Ivirius.UI.Controls.Test folder is the more experimental testing environment for the controls which is used during active development of a new release and is updated with every single change to the library's controls.
